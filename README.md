Consolidated Plant Watering System (CPWS)

This is a DIY Arduino project to create a an automatic plant watering system. The project consists of a calibration program and a watering program. The calibration program is used to calibrate the soil moisture sensor. The watering program is the program that runs after the sensor is calibrated and the system is set up. It takes moisture readings every 24 hours to determine if the plant needs to be watered. If the program determines the soil is too dry it will start the water pump for a user defined number of seconds.
